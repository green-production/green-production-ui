# Goals of our product: 

1) A consumer can make a more informed decision on choosing their raw materials/product parts/products based on a score weâ€™ll provide through an algorithm leveraging Watson AI on parameters like recyclability, reusability, cost, manufacturing impact on environment, carbon footprint, end to end lifetime of a product, disposability, etc.  

2) We will provide an interface and channel for our seller who will be selling materials/products based on a number of parameters meeting our environment friendly guidelines of recycling, reusability, minimum carbon footprint, etc. Every seller will host/sell only environment friendly materials/products by sharing information and filling out one-time minimum form pertaining to the production process of the product which will be later approved by our team to be hosted in the platform if it meets all the sustainable consumption and production patterns. 

3) Consumer can compare the information available for a material/product from different sources to make the best possible decision based on price, quality, carbon footprint, etc. Beside comparison, we will also be leveraging Watson AI with other data sources and list out analytical useful data on every product like manufacturing cost, raw materials used, the impact of the product on the environment, how to reduce the impact, alternative solutions, how to reuse, how to connect to other organizations, companies for recycling, product lifecycle, etc 

4) The platform will provide information on best practices of using recyclable materials as raw materials to reduce the carbon footprint of final product and how efficiently a product can be reused.
